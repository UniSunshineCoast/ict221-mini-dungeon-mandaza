# ICT221_MiniDungeon

Starting code for the MiniDungeon game.

Some image files are provided in "resources" folder. You can use them in the GUI. Or you can choose your own image files.

The image files located in "resources" folder can be simply referred to with the file name (without telling the path) in your Java code.

## Text UI

The MiniDungeon game also supports a text-based (console) UI. To run the text UI, execute the main method in the GameEngine class (for example, via your IDE or by running “java dungeon.engine.GameEngine” from the command line). In the text UI, you can use the keys “u” (up), “d” (down), “l” (left), “r” (right) to move and “q” to quit.
